			 	Koko was a female western lowland gorilla known for having learned a large number of hand signs from a modified version of American Sign Language (ASL).
			 	Koko was born to her mother, Jacqueline and father, Bwana on July 4, 1971, at the San Francisco Zoo. Koko was
			 	the 50th gorilla born in captivity and one of the first gorillas accepted by her mother in captivity. Koko remained
			  with her mother until the age of one when she was taken to the zoo's hospital to be treated for a life-threatening illness.
				Patterson originally cared for Koko at the San Francisco Zoo as part of her doctoral research at Stanford University
				after Koko developed a life-threatening illness. Koko was loaned to Patterson under the condition that she would
				spend at least 4 years with Koko. Eventually, Koko remained with Patterson, supported by The Gorilla Foundation,
				which Patterson founded to support gorilla research and conservation.
			 	Koko lived most of her life in Woodside, California, at The Gorilla Foundation's preserve in the Santa Cruz
				Mountains. The name "Hanabiko" (花火子), lit. 'fireworks child',
			 	is of Japanese origin and is a reference to her date of birth, the Fourth of July. Koko gained public
			 	attention upon a report of her having adopted a kitten as a pet and creating a name for him. Her instructor
			 	and caregiver, Francine Patterson, reported that Koko had an active vocabulary of more than 1,000 signs of
			 	what Patterson calls "Gorilla Sign Language" (GSL). In contrast to other experiments attempting to teach
			 	sign language to non-human primates, Patterson simultaneously exposed Koko to spoken English from an early
			  age. It was reported that Koko understood approximately 2,000 words of spoken English, in addition to the
				signs. Koko's life and learning process has been described by Patterson and various collaborators in books,
				peer-reviewed scientific articles, and on a website.

			<h3>Floquet de Neu "Snowflake"<br>(c. 1964 – 2003)</h3>

				Snowflake was captured in the Rio Muni region in Equatorial Guinea on October 1, 1966 by ethnic Fang farmer
				Benito Mañé. Mañé had killed the rest of Snowflake's gorilla group (who were normal in color). Mañé then kept
				Snowflake at his home for four days before transporting him to Bata, where he was purchased by primatologist
				Jordi Sabater Pi. Snowflake was a Western lowland gorilla with non-syndromic oculocutaneous albinism. Snowflake
			 	had unpigmented skin and hair. Snowflake had poor vision, which is associated with albinism. A test to try to
			 	determine whether Snowflake had a central blind spot did not find one. nowflake fathered twenty-two offspring
			 	by three different mates, or "dams". Six of his offspring survived to adulthood. None of Snowflake's offspring
			 	were albino, but all should be heterozygous, recessive carriers, for the albino gene. Half of his grandchildren
			 	likely carry the albino gene. If both parents were albino gene carriers they have 25% chance of producing an
			 	albino offspring. As of May 2014, Snowflake had a total of 21 grandchildren (11 survived) and four great-grandchildren
			 	(all living). Snowflake's great-grandson N'Kou has pink fingers which is perhaps suggestive of partial albinism.
			 	In 2001, Snowflake was diagnosed with an unusual form of skin cancer, almost certainly related to his albinism
			 	condition. By 2003, Snowflake's health began to deteriorate. After he began losing interest in his usual activities,
			 	isolating himself from other gorillas and exhibiting signs of physical pain, Snowflake's keepers decided to euthanize him.
			 	The decision was publicly announced in September 2003.

			<h3>Winston<br>(29 years old)</h3>

				In the Overwatch lore, Winston is a 29-year old genetically engineered gorilla. A scientist and adventurer,
				Winston was formerly based in the Horizon Lunar Colony, located on the Moon. The Horizon Lunar Colony was established
				as part of humanity's space exploration; some of its first inhabitants were genetically enhanced gorillas, like Winston,
				used in tests relating to prolonged space habitation. Due to displaying rapid brain development from the experiment's
				gene therapy, Winston was taken under Dr. Harold Winston's wing; Dr. Winston taught the young gorilla about science and
				inspired Winston about human ingenuity. The other gorillas soon led an uprising and killed the colony's scientists,
				claiming it as their own. Winston took the name of his caretaker, created a rocket and flew to Earth where he would
				join Overwatch. While in Overwatch, Winston invented the chronal accelerator, which helped fellow Overwatch member
				Tracer maintain control of her time; before this, Tracer suffered from a chronal dissociation which kept her
				from keeping a physical form in the present. Winston made an appearance in Blizzard's 2014 cinematic trailer for
				Overwatch. Winston also appeared Recall, the first of a series of animated Overwatch shorts released by Blizzard.
				In the Recall short, Winston is seen recalling memories of his days in Overwatch, as well as his extended Horizon
				Lunar Colony backstory. Additionally, Winston fights back against an attack from Talon, a terrorist organization
				opposed to Overwatch, and seeking to eliminate former Overwatch members. Winston is attacked at his home and laboratory
				on Horizon Lunar Colony. In previous events within Overwatch's lore, the Overwatch organization ended with the United
			  Nations' Petras Act, making any Overwatch-related activities illegal. However, at the end of the short, Winston
				initiates a recall in an effort to bring back Overwatch.
